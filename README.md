# Web Chat Application (Server)
I created a chat application 
the Backend is in this repository,
and the client side is in the front end repository.

The chat application is built with react and express
with socket.io.

### If you want to run this make sure to fill up your mongodb cluster link in database/config.js

let me know what you think :).

there is also a live demo on:
https://chatappclient.netlify.app

(if it doesnt respond after you try to register/login wait a few minutes and try again,
because the server might need to boot back up due to inactivity)
